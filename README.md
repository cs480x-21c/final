This project aims to present various aspects of WPI finances and compare these figures across a span of fiscal years from 2009-2020.

## Code and Files

The js folder in this repository stores all of the code which is embedded in the index.html file. These files include the code for the creation of the graphs in our visualization. Additionally, the style.css file is linked to the index.html file to provide styling of different elements. Our main source of data containing all datasets for the visualization can be seen in the csv files. 

## Technical/Design Achievements
All user interaction and capabilities are functioning on the project website. 

Some technical achievements...
- Users are able to hover over the bar graphs to view the data in a more specifically with the exact data point presented
- Users are additionally able to hover over the multi-line graphs to view the data at each specified point to show for the percent change of tuition and total liabilities and net assets over time 

Some design achievements...
- There is a consistent color scheme throughout the webpage
- Once user hovers over the seleced bar graph, the color of the bar is highlighted to indicate the selected entity
- Legends were added to specific graphs to identify the different datasets being represented 

A brief description of each graph is also included on the project webpage along with a video describing the intent and purpose of the project.
