## Product Value Stacked Area Chart

Most of the code for the stacked area chart were written from scratch using D3. Some code was adapted from this [this template for stacked area charts](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/stackedarea_template.html) and code used for earlier assignments with reference to [the d3-shape repo for stacks](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stacks). To swap between looking at imports and exports, click the button below the chart. To drill down into a category, left click on the area in the chart or the corresponding label in the legend. To drill back up, right click on any of the areas or parts of the legend. If a category can be drilled down into, hovering over it will turn the cursor into a pointer hand (as opposed to the standard cursor). This makes it visible whether you can or cannot drill down any further into a desired category.
