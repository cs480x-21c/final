## Product Value Stacked Area Chart

Most of the code for the stacked area chart were written from scratch using D3. Some code was adapted from [this template for stacked area charts](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/stackedarea_template.html) and code used for earlier assignments with reference to [the d3-shape repo for stacks](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stacks). To swap between looking at imports and exports, click the button below the chart. To drill down into a category, left click on the area in the chart or the corresponding label in the legend. To drill back up, right click on any of the areas or parts of the legend. If a category can be drilled down into, hovering over it will turn the cursor into a pointer hand (as opposed to the standard cursor). This makes it visible whether you can or cannot drill down any further into a desired category.

## Product Value Treemap

We used this [treemap example](https://bl.ocks.org/erlenstar/43d822f70e4c669f001ec72d23434fbf) as the base for our treemap. The button at the top of the page swaps the treemap between imports and exports. To change the year the treemap is on, you can change the slider labeled year. To change the aggregation level, change the aggregation level slider. This changes how generalized the treemap is. Hovering over each item in the treemap shows what import/export you are hovering over as well as the value in $1000 USD of the import/export. We used [this example](https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369) as a base for the hovering functionality.

## Overall Trade Value / Growth Plot

The majority of the code written for this scatter plot was from scratch. The basic layout of the plot was adapted from [this basic scatterplot template](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_basic.html) as well as adaption of transitions from [this visualization with transitions](http://bl.ocks.org/WilliamQLiu/bd12f73d0b79d70bfbae). Swapping between imports and exports as well as total and growth is done by clicking the cooresponding button which will update to show you the opposite option. There are four total options for the graph with these two buttons. Pictures and breakdown of this vis can be seen in the process book.
