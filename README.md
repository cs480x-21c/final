Our final project aims to analyze data about Covid-19 by
creating our own visualizations including brush views, pie
chart, bar charts, bubble charts and map. Our findings is that
as time goes by, the total death numbers are keeping increasing,
The total number of new cases tested positive for each
month is generally at thea peak in 2020 Dec and falls a lot
in 2021. In some states that there are a lot of people, for
example California and Florida, the numbers of airports per 1000 
people are low but the death rates are high.

Notice:
Everytime the user refreshes the page, it may take some time 
(2-3 seconds) for the color of the map to render. So please
be a little bit patient. Thanks!
