### Objective
Given the economic upheaval of the past year, our team wanted to choose a project focusing on the financial spending of the government: specifically the difference between how the U.S. spends money on military endeavors versus social programs. 

### Data
We sifted through multiple databases and other data sources to find the information necessary for our project. We changed courses a few times based on much data was available, how specific it was, and the points we were trying to convey to our reader. Although not all of the following data sources are represented in our final version, all of them were helpful in our research and understanding of this topic.

For most of our data we had to employ some about of cleaning. This involving downloading spreadsheets or CSV files, selecting the data we wished to use, and converting into our desired format (CSV or JSON). 


Visualizations

Our project website contains many sections. First, we felt it was important to convey our objectives for this project, as well as provided explanations of our visualizations and additional research to our user. 

Next we have our section on U.S. military spending, with a bar chart and a treemap. The bar chart shows data on the total military spending from 2003 - 2021 (2021 projected). Important events are denoted to give the user an informed idea of global events that impacted spending, and to clarify the y-values, the cost of each year is displayed under the x-axis when that bar is hovered on. To take a further look into U.S. budget, we have our tree map. [Explain more abt treemap when merged in]

Our next section focuses on U.S. social spending, and like the military section, contains a bar graph and a treemap.
