This project aims to present various aspects of WPI finances and compare these figures across a span of fiscal years from 2009-2020.

The js folder in this repository stores all of the code which in embedded in the index.html file. These files include the code for the creation of the graphs in our visualization. Additionally, the style.css file is linked to the index.html file to provide styling of different elements. Our main source of data containing all datasets for the visualization can be seen in the csv files. 

All user interaction and capabilities are functioning on the project website. Users are able to hover and highlight data points with a dialogue box indicating their selected entity below each graph. A brief description of each graph is also included on the project webpage along with a video describing the intent and purpose of the project.
