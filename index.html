                Aggregation Structure:

                    -0: Agricultural, forestry, and fishery products
                        -01: Agricultural Products
                            -011: Cash Grains and other crops
                                -0111: Wheat
                            -013: Field crops, except cash grains
                                -0131: Cotton and cottonseed

                        -09:
                            etc

                    -1: Mineral Commodities

                    -2: Manufactured commodities

                    -3: Manufactured commodities not identified by kind

                    -9: Other commodities



                    Structure:
                        -Highest aggregation is single digit with 5 seperate categories listed above.
                        -Anything within each category will start with that number followed by another number (always adding numbers to the end).
                            -Continue with this pattern until 4 digit numbers where the final layer of aggregation is

                    Example:
                        Given the 4 digit number "3524"
                            -Looking at "3" its identified as "Manufacture commodity not identified by kind"
                            -Looking at "35" its identified as "Machinery, except electrical"
                            -Looking at "352" its identified as "Farm and garden machinery equipment"
                            -Looking at "3524" its identified as "Lawn and garden equipment, and parts, nspf" (nspf -- not specified)
