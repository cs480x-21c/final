    Over the past 20 years, the United States has faced some of the worst economic crises in history.
    From the Great Recession of 2007 - 2009 to the 2020 Recession (the worst since the
    Great Depression [1]), Americans have been struggling. Currently, we are battling the
    physical, emotional, and economic toll of COVID-19. In the past year unemployment has peaked at
    an unprecedented 14.8% [2], and many Americans who were lucky enough to survive a COVID infection
    (and some family members whose loved ones did not) have been plunged into medical debt, even with
    private insurance [3].
</p>
<p>
    Despite these struggles, the United States has seen its budget become increasingly militarized.
    The US is the largest military spender in the world, larger than the next 10 highest spenders
    combined [4]. Within the military budget itself, programs such as Veterans Affairs is dwarfed by spending
    by the Department of Defense and overseas contingency operations (OCO). The OCO, which includes
    the cost of wars, has spent over $2 trillion financing the War on Terror [5]: a war which is conservatively
    estimated to have displaced 37 million people and left over 800,000 dead [6].

    Below, you can see the total military spending for the US from the past 19 years. This visualization
    shows a distinct upwards trend, despite troop withdrawal from both Afghanistan and Iraq [7], and an
    announcement by President Obama in 2013 that the War on Terror was over [6]. Also note how the U.S.
    military budget is reactionary to external events: increasing and decreasing as necessary in response
    to outside circumstances.

<p>
    Below you can see the total social spending for the US from the past 17 years. An important aspect to note
    is that unlike the military budget, which is reactionary and increases dramatically, the budget for social
    programs responds only to inflation. This means that despite the multiple financial crises that have hit the
    United States in our lifetime, the government does not offer additional economic support to its citizens.
    This is in stark contrast to the U.S. governmentâ€™s history of corporate bailouts, which occur in amounts
    of billions to trillions of dollars, and a luxury only afforded to Americans recently at the height of the
    pandemic [8].

    Below is a Treemap + Pie chart of the years 2017-2019 of the military budget of top nations. It is clear that the United States
    spends billions of dollars more than all other countries. In fact, in 2019, the U.S. Military Spending budget
    was larger than the next 10 countries combined [9].

    This animation shows the clear increase in military spending in the early 2000s, and a decline between 2011-2016, with a now sharp rise
    in more military spending.
