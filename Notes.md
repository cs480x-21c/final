# Team SCJ - WPI Financial Reports



#### Motivation and Objectives

We wanted to be able to visualize the WPI financial reports and how they change year to year. We thought it would be a funny, interesting, and relatable data set to work with that everyone could think about. We want to know how the financials change year to year, what  WPI is spending money on, and where WPI's assets actually are.

#### Data / Data Processing

https://www.wpi.edu/offices/controller
We gathered data from WPI financial reports for every fiscal year beginning in 2009-2020.

From where and how are you collecting your data? If appropriate, provide a link to your data sources. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup and transformation?
WPI releases financial statements for every fiscal year here: https://www.wpi.edu/offices/controller
We will have to do some data scraping but it shouldnt be too bad as they are pretty uniform.

#### Visualization Design
How will you display your data? Provide some general ideas that you have for the visualization design.
This we dont know yet, but probably some comparison charts to show year to year changes, as well as some tree maps to show what percent of the budget goes where.


#### Anticipated Challenges and Additional Notes
Give us some idea of the challenges you're anticipating with this project. Feel free to describe how you plan to mitigate risk if you have ideas. Also, use this section to communicate anything else you think we might need.
Our challenges will mostly be finding the right graphs and charts top use to display our data. We will also have to do quite a bit of data scraping. (edited)
