We will use the visual arts to study the economic behavior of individuals, businesses, government, and other institutions and draw parallels to modern economies. We will learn, for example, about the tulip mania, the first documented speculative asset bubble, and discover that the Dutch were not that different from the exuberant traders of the modern stock market. The course will cover relevant topics in economic theory and will provide opportunities for students to conduct basic economic analysis.

The course proceeds by first examining how economic growth and economic development are measured and how the various nations of the world compare according to well-known social and economic indicators. Theories of economic growth and theories of economic development are then examined, as are the various social and cultural structures that are thought to influence economic progress. The inputs to economic growth and development (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability, education, technical change), and the possible distributions of income and levels of employment that result from their use, is considered next. Domestic economic problems and policies such as development planning, the choice of sectorial policies, the choice of monetary and fiscal policies, rapid population growth, and urbanization and urban economic development are then examined.

Since entering the ‘take-off’ phase of economic growth in the late 1970’s, China has exhibited some of the world’s strongest economic growth rates. Part of this trend has been that millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. The relationship between growth, poverty and development, however, is not simple, and is often mediated by environmental impacts that have been unevenly experienced by different regions, rural/urban populations, and socioeconomic and demographic groups. Put differently, Chinese economic development has brought with it environmental problems and policy responses that are not evenly distributed among citizens. Through the perspectives of environmental justice, this course looks at the impacts of: economic development in China (pollution, migration, energy requirements and foreign investment); policy responses to environmental problems such as urban planning and alternative energy solutions; and the growing number of environmental movements in China that are focused on issues such as pollution and human displacement.

Worst-case scenarios envision irrevocable degradation of the earth’s natural systems, but virtually every analysis sees the need for major change worldwide to cope with problems such as global warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, and population growth, not to mention exponential increases in \"conventional\" pollutants in newly industrialized countries. The global environment issues represent a \"second-generation\" of environmental policy in which the focus of concern has moved from national regulations to international law and institutions. In addition, the environment has emerged as a major aspect of international trade, conditioning corporate investment and accounting for some $200 billion in sales of pollution control equipment in 1991. Exploration of the genesis and implications of these phenomena is the essence of the course. Topically, the material begins with the nature of global environmental problems, drawing on literature from large-scale global modeling as well as particular analyses of the problems mentioned above. Approximately half the course focuses on international laws and institutions, including multilateral treaties (e.g., the Montreal Protocol limiting CFC use, ocean dumping, biodiversity), international institutions (UNEP, the Rio Convention, the OECD) and private initiatives (international standards organizations, ICOLP (Industry Committee for Ozone Layer Protection), etc.) In addition, US policy toward global environmental issues will be compared with that in Japan, Europe and developing countries, from which it differs significantly.

In the twenty-first century, the region continues to embody both avant-garde and traditional forms of cultural and economic production, and a diverse set of social and political circumstances. Study of modern Latin America and its people engages with these complexities and illuminates the structure and function of the modern world. Incorporating perspectives and practices from history, literary and film studies, the social sciences and other disciplines, this course can enable students to engage with patterns of colonialism, nationalism and social and economic development in Latin America, and the region’s many responses to contemporary cultural, social, political and economic issues.

Applications are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is based on the premise that there are common aspects to all good designs. These commons aspects, stated in the independence and information axioms, facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Analysis of processes and products is considered from the perspective of supporting product and process design. Fundamental methods of engineering analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are developed. Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces. The ability to generalize is emphasized to facilitate development of analyses and design methods with broader applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. The grade is from performance on homework and quizzes given and delivered on-line and on a design project on manufacturing processes. Projects can be from work or dissertations on many kinds of systems and services, in addition to traditional manufacturing processes and tools.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course.

The method builds on existing strategy concepts, but moves substantially beyond them, by using the system dynamics method to understand and direct performance through time. Topics covered include: strategy, performance and resources; resources and accumulation; the ‘Strategic Architecture’; Resource Development; Rivalry and the Dynamics of Competition; Strategy, Policy and Information Feedback; Resource Attributes; Intangible Resources; Strategy, Capabilities and Organization; Industry Dynamics and Scenarios. Case studies and models are assigned to students for analysis.","credits":"3.000 OR 4.500 Credit hours","levels":"Undergraduate, Graduate","types":"Lecture, Video tape, Web","department_title":"Social Science/Policy Studies Department"},{"title":"ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS","department_code":"SD","code":"561","description":"This course helps students develop understanding and proficiency in system dynamics simulation of energy and environmental problems. The majority of the content is devoted to case studies that focus on energy, water and environmental problems. Major business applications deal with boom and bust in power plant construction and a similar pattern of boom and bust in real-­‐estate construction. The text used is: Ford, Andrew. 2009. Modeling the Environment, 2nd Edition. Island Press. The book’s website ( http://www.wsu.edu/~forda/AA2nd.html ) provides model files, background on the case studies and a wide variety of extra exercises. For example, Students interested in water resource management can simulate the complex tradeoffs in the management of large river basins; students interested in water quality can experiment with models of accelerated eutrophication of fresh water lakes. A highlight of SD 561 is a class project. One option is to select one of the more challenging sets of exercises from the book (or the book’s website). Such a project is often the best way to conclude SD561 for students who are new to system dynamics. The other option is to improve one of the models from the book or the website. This option is usually best for students with previous course work in system dynamics. Their project report will explain why their simulations are an improvement on the published simulations. And they will explain whether the conclusions from their modeling reinforce or contradict the conclusions from the book.

The first acquaints a student with dynamic macroeconomic data and the stylized facts seen in most macroeconomic systems. Characteristics of the data related to economic growth, economic cycles, and the interactions between economic growth and economic cycles that are seen as particularly important when viewed through the lens of system dynamics will be emphasized. The second acquaints a student with the basics of macroeconomic growth and business cycle theory. This is accomplished by presenting well-known models of economic growth and instability, from both the orthodox and heterodox perspectives, via system dynamics. The third part attempts to enhance a student’s ability to build and critique dynamic macroeconomic models by addressing such topics as the translation of difference and differential equation models into their equivalent system dynamics representation, fitting system dynamics models to macroeconomic data, and evaluating (formally and informally) a model’s validity for the purpose of theory selection.

Contrary to traditional artificial intelligence research, the goal is not to imitate human behavior as such, but to make the machine able to understand the expectations, goals, knowledge, information needs, and desires of a user in terms of a specific computing environment. The computer representation of this information about a user is called a user model, and systems that construct and utilize such models are called user modeling systems. A simple example of a user model would be an e-commerce site which makes use of the user’s and similar users’ purchasing and browsing behavior in order to better understand the user’s preferences. In this class, the focus is on obtaining a general understanding of user modeling, and an understanding of how to apply user modeling techniques. Students will read seminal papers in the user modeling literature, as well as complete a course project where students build a system that explicitly models the user.

In addition to helping students understand what makes a good research question and why, some elementary statistics will be covered. Furthermore, students will use and implement computationally intensive techniques such as randomization, bootstrapping, and permutation tests. The course also covers experiments involving human subjects, and some of the statistical and non-statistical difficulties researchers often encounter while performing such work (e.g., IRB (Institutional Review Board), correlated trials, and small sample sizes). While this course is designed for students in Human Computer Interaction, Interactive Media and Game Development, and Learning Sciences and Technologies, it is appropriate for any student with programming experience who is doing empirical research.

This course is intended to answer the why, what and how of MBSE. The course provides background and motivation for transitioning to MBSE from a document centric approach to systems engineering. The course provides a foundation for MBSE by first introducing SysML as a descriptive language for modeling systems in terms of their requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints. The course then introduces the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) as a method for applying SysML to support the specification, architecture design, analysis, and verification of complex systems. A systems modeling tool is also introduced and used throughout the course. Applying MBSE on class projects help the student to grasp the fundamentals. This course is expected to provide the foundations of the systems modeling language, method, and tool to enable the student to get started with MBSE on real projects.

This class will explore foundational acting techniques drawn from the teachings and legacy of Konstantin Stanislavski (1863 – 1938), a Russian actor, director, producer and founder of the Moscow Art Theatre. His “Stanislavski Method” is one of the most influential acting approaches in the 20th and 21st centuries. This approach will include analysis and exploration “on our feet” of such terms as unit, objective, subtext, action, among others, as well as focus on incorporating characterization and given circumstances. We will do this through in-class exercises, as well as monologue and scenework onstage and on video from a variety of texts that employ naturalistic language (for example, Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull, Tennessee William’s The Glass Menagerie, Lynn Nottage’s Sweat, and Theresa Rebeck’s Mauritius, among others.) Further, we will explore the historical and social background of these playwrights in order to contextualize the ideas and mores behind the drama. Additionally, each actor will be expected to do research in order to better prepare themselves to dive into these theatrical worlds. Beyond acting skills, the student will learn valuable skills in public speaking and in conveying clear, complex ideas. Recommended Background: Some theatre or acting experience is desirable but the course is suitable for anyone with interest in the subject.","credits":"3.000 Credit hours","levels":"Undergraduate, Graduate","types":"Lecture, Web","department_title":"Humanities and Arts Department","attributes":"Humanities and Arts"},{"title":"INTRODUCTION TO THEATRICAL PRODUCTION DESIGN","department_code":"TH","code":"111X","description":"How does a play leap from the page to the stage? Certainly, a director’s concept and interpretation are the driving forces in producing and mounting a live performance of a script. But she doesn’t do it alone. In this course, we will discuss the cornerstones of theatrical production design, from interpreting a script to creating onstage symbology. We explore the various disciplines involved in theatrical design, from scenery to costumes, lighting to sound, props to projections. We’ll start by analyzing a script and discussing the intention of the playwright far beyond the written word. From there, we will determine what the physical needs of the production are in order to propel the story. We’ll then dive deeper, tapping into the creative, aesthetic aspects of design, not just the function, but the form. By dissecting the nuance of a script and reading between the lines, we’ll discover the poetry in good design and why it takes a live performance beyond the basics of the plot.
